Every time I start up my Pixel, I am presented with a friendly reminder that I am in developer mode. If I tap, touch, or otherwise look at the space bar at this point, the chromebook is supposed to restart in normal mode and completely wipe out crouton and everything I have in my Ubuntu installation. So I carefully place my fingers over "Ctrl" and "D" and, peering through sweat drops, press down. Whew. Safe.

It's almost as if they want to reinforce the idea that this kind of setup is not appropriate for the average user. It's barely appropriate for me. But one really nice side-effect is that it makes me *really* good about checking in my code after every completed task. I do backup my chroot to an SD card every now and again, but I generally git push like it's going out of style. That silver lining may actually be fairly profound as my coding career moves forward. 

Don't press the spacebar.
