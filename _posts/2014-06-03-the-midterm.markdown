I started this confounded log to record my learnings, so I should probably write something about that, rather than my struggles with setting up workflows and environments. I suppose those are equally important, but my class is about Ruby on Rails. We have just finished 5 weeks on Ruby, and were tasked with writing a CLI app that takes in some json from an open api and does something with it. Simple and open-ended.

The scope of the project is as follows:

1. User types in the name of a city.
2. Program uses openweathermap.org API to find current weather conditions for that city.
3. Print to console the conditions, and if the specific weather condition is recognized, print out some ASCII art of the weather.
4. User is asked if they want to exit or try another city.

One thing at a time.
