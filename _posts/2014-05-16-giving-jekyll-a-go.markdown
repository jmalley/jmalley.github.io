I wouldn't call myself a *slow* learner, but let's just say I won't be getting any speeding tickets on Skill Aquisition Highway. To help facilitate my education, I am forcing myself to blog about everything that I learn that is even remotely useful to me. While this effort began on tumblr, I found that my tumblr friends are not the right audience for endless techical epiphanies. They just can't compete with the deluge of "heh"-inducing gifs.

Enter github pages and the [Jekyll blogging framework][jekyll]. Switching to this method has the added benefit of teaching me something while I blog. Knowing [markdown][markdown] seems to be important, particularly in the github community, and forcing myself to use [Sass][sass] here as i develop the layout is a skill that will help me at work. Perhaps most importantly, I am now going to be using git everyday, which seems like the best way to get comfortable with it.

{% highlight ruby %}
def begin
  puts "Off we go."
end
{% endhighlight %}
