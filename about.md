I'm an entrepreneur and front-end developer, currently working on my [third company][company]. I've embarked on a mission to learn back-end development to ensure my stack is as full as the next guy's. Currently enrolled in [General Assembly's][ga] back end web development course in NYC, I'm using Jekyll and Github Pages to record revelations, epiphanies, and other notes for future reference.

Thanks for stopping by!
